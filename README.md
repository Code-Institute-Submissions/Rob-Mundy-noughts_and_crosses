NOUGHTS & CROSSES is a Python terminal-based version of the classic paper and pencil game also known as "Tic-tac-toe".

Users can try to beat the computer by placing 3 of their marks (x's or o's) in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally. There are 8 possible ways to win.

A stalemate will be declared if all of the spaces are populated without either player placing 3 in a row.
