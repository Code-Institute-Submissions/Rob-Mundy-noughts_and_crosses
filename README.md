Users can try to beat the computer by placing 3 of their marks (x's or o's) in a row.

+ ## How to play

NOUGHTS & CROSSES is a classic strategy game that can trace its roots back to the Romans or even ancient Egyptians!  [See wikipedia for more info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

There are 8 possible ways to win by placing 3 of your chosen marks in a row horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

A stalemate will be declared if all of the spaces are populated without either player placing 3 in a row.

In this version the player inputs ther choice of mar (x or o) and the initial board is drawn.

Rather than presenting empty spaces and using coordinates, the available spaces on the board are presented as numbers 1 - 9, arranged as they would be on a keypad.

The game alternates between the user and computer, and their marks are entered onto the board in place of the numbers.

The winner is the player that places 3 of their marks in a row.
